### Features

A simple lighweight mobile web interface for the music player daemon (http://musicpd.org). Intended for use in conjunction with the paradigm connector to provide control from mobile data network devices over LAN-based music players.

Intended for a multi-user environment, where controls with varying permissions may be granted and revoked by a separate web based control panel. This control is part of the project at www.playnode.ca providing a platform for DJs to serve background music in commercial establishments.
